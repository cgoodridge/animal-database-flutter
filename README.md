# Project Sanctuary

Welcome to Project Sanctuary. An app that compiles the info of multiple species of animals across the planet.

## Why?

This project was inspired initially by the the Cartoon Network show Ben10. Originally it was meant to show all the alien characters from the
show but along the way I decided to switch things around to use real animals as way to learn more about the animal kingdom.

## How?

I built this project with Flutter and Firebase with Riverpod for state management and data sourced from both [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/) 
and [A-Z Animals](https://a-z-animals.com/).

## Features

- User authentication(Account creation and login)
- The ability to save animals into custom collections
- The ability to search animals by location, scientific name, common name or any other classification type
- Map showing regions for each species
- Ability to add new animals(if you have the right permissions)
